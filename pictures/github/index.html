<h1>My 8_year_long account get banned by github because I said fuck</h1>

<p>In US movie or TV shows, it is normal to hear "what the fuck is going on here?" kind of words. But the fuck isn't really point to anyone.</p>

<p>But it seems like for the whole GitHub community(or a private company), once someone said a fuck that does not point to anyone, they will get banned.</p>

<a href="./solved.html" target="_blank">Github restored my account after I deleted the fuck word</a>
