# Timer

```c
#include <msp430.h>

void main(void)
{
    WDTCTL = WDTPW + WDTHOLD;                 // Stop WDT

    P6DIR |= BIT0;                            // P6.0 output

    TBCCTL0 = CCIE;                           // CCR0 interrupt enabled
    TBCCR0 = 50000;                           // Counting number
    TBCTL = TBSSEL_2 + MC_2;                  // SMCLK + Continuous up count mode

    _BIS_SR(LPM0_bits + GIE);                 // Enter LPM0 w/ interrupt

    while (1)
    {
        ;
    }
}

// Timer B0 interrupt service routine
#pragma vector=TIMERB0_VECTOR
__interrupt void Timer_B(void)
{
    P6OUT ^= BIT0;                            // Toggle P6.0
    TBCCR0 += 50000;                          // Add Offset to CCR0
}
```

## Control Timer

TBCCTL0 = Timer B Capture/Compare Control 0

CCIE = Capture/compare interrupt enable

TBCCR0 = Timer B Capture/Compare Register 0

> Since I can't find any explanation about TBCCR, I treat it as a variable where saves the `delay time` for timer B

TBCTL = Timer B Control

TBSSEL\_2 = Timer B Source-clock Select 2 \(which is SMCLK\)

* ~~TBCLK: Time based clock. \(I don't know this\)~~
* ACLK: Auxiliary clock, is usually a 32kHz crystal clock. It is used for peripheral modules that require a low-frequency clock \(e.g. real-time-clock, ...\)
* SMCLK: Sub-main clock, is usually a high frequency clock and it is used for peripheral modules \(e.g. Timers, serial communication modules, ...\)
* ~~INCLK: \(I don't know this\)~~
* ~~MCLK: Master clock, is used as clock source for the CPU.~~

MC\_2 = mode control: 2 - Continuous up

> "Continuous" mode is typically the most used one. It counts until the overflow of the timer register, then restarts from zero.
>
> You can also use the "up" mode. In that case the timer counter should automatically reset to zero after reaching CCR. \(MC\_1 will do that\)

## Define an Interrupt Service Routine

\_BIS\_SR\(mask\) = \_bis\_SR\_register\(mask\) = **\_\_bis\_SR\_register** sets the bits specified in **mask** in the MSP430 status register \(i.e. it bitwise-ors **mask** into the status register\).

LPM0 = Low Power Mode 0

> You could view those details at `MSP430F169 Datasheet.pdf`

GIE = General Interrupt Enable

\#pragma vector = TIMERB\_VECTOR

> If you write an ISR\(Interrupt Service Routine\), it is just a function. A function with specific entry/exit code. It is a function that is never called by anyone in the source code. So it is a candidate for being discarded at link \(or compile\) time.

> The "\#pragma vector" generates a reference to the following function and locates it at the TIMERB\_VECTOR position in the interrupt vector table. So the ISR gets referenced \(and the linker wonâ€™t discard it\) and the CPU knows where to jump in case of an TIMERB interrupt.

## Calculate the counting number for a timer

![](../../.gitbook/assets/mspf169_characteristics_on_different_mode.png)

From the above sheet we know `sub-main clock (SMCLK)` is  $$1 MHz$$ at `low-power mode 0` .

So there must have some ways to calculate that counting number.
