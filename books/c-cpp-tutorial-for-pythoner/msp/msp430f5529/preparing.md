# Preparing

## The mission

I just want to use it as quickly as possible.

## The Toolchain

* VSCode
* PlatformIO Plugin for VSCode
* Arduino\(energia\) framework and coding style

### VScode

### PlatformIO

### Arduino Framework

### Shortcuts

Due to my less knowledge, I don't know how to configure task.json under VSCode to make a "Build and Upload" operation.

So here are the alternative operations that working:

* ctrl+shift+B: build
* ctrl+alt+U: upload
