# Hello World!

## Why I start this book?

Well, we love programming. But sometimes, it's kind of frustrating to us.

So I was thinking if I could make it simpler for us to learn, to enjoy.

Here it is, let's get started!

## Why you need to learn C/C++?

In a short time, no, I don't recommend you to learn it, because it is too hard and impossible to master. Learn something else like Python, Javascript, Golang would be better for you.

But in the long term, I believe you'll get rewards by learning it. Because it's a language that has been tested by time. And other languages are made by it.
