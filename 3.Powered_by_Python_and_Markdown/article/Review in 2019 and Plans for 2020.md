### Failed to do at 2019:

1. Try to be normal at the university. ---------- **I can never be a normal person. I seek for extreme (perfect).**

2. Try to accumulate knowledge instead of crazy output at school. ----------- **No! I just don't have any free time to learn useful stuff due to the fucking school stuff. (I can't even sleep well, remember? (6 hours per day))**

3. Learning English by writing notes (including university notes). ------------- **Oh my god! In the end, I totally give up, I wrote my notes using Chinese! Because I just can not find the right translation for what I have learned during the class. (I think it's a sign of useless: It at least indicates that other people in another country won't learn it.)**




### Have Done in 2019:

4. Don't eager to code at school, do it after you get home. ---------- **I don't have time anyway...**

5. Body exercise. ------- **I did it at home in the last month of this year after I bought an indoor horizontal bar and a boxing punching sandbag.**
