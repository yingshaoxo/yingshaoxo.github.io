0. format your disk using PE system, we need a clear disk, or something will going wrong

1. use `refus`  to make USB driver

2. just to be safe, use MBR based mix mode

3. use `dd` mode to defend Wi-Fi firmware missing (iso file belongs to Windows, and Windows is bad on drivers)

4. if you can disable secure boot, you can use UEFI in installation, else just use BIOS

5. if you failed, try more option in -1 and 3 step.

6. links may help
