<h1>Review in 2019 and Plans for 2020</h1>

<h3>Failed to do at 2019:</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Try to be normal at the university. ---------- <strong>I can never be a normal person. I seek for extreme (perfect).</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Try to accumulate knowledge instead of crazy output at school. ----------- <strong>No! I just don't have any free time to learn useful stuff due to the fucking school stuff. (I can't even sleep well, remember? (6 hours per day))</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Learning English by writing notes (including university notes). ------------- <strong>Oh my god! In the end, I totally give up, I wrote my notes using Chinese! Because I just can not find the right translation for what I have learned during the class. (I think it's a sign of useless: It at least indicates that other people in another country won't learn it.)</strong></p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Have Done in 2019:</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Don't eager to code at school, do it after you get home. ---------- <strong>I don't have time anyway...</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Body exercise. ------- <strong>I did it at home in the last month of this year after I bought an indoor horizontal bar and a boxing punching sandbag.</strong></p></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><p>Learned how to use vue.js: https://medium.com/@yingshaoxo/how-to-use-store-in-vue-js-cce2a1329e33</p></li>
<li><p>Learned how to control PX4 drone with RaspberryPi and Python: https://youtu.be/SOdEuAY_VfM</p></li>
<li><p>Learned how to use Gun.js: https://yingshaoxo.blogspot.com/2020/01/basics-gun.html</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Plan to do at 2020:</h3>

<li><p>Keep learning to become an expert on Machine Learning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Try anything</strong> to get money at home.</p></li>
